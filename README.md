This is a graphics program optimized (?) for Rasberry Pi.
The screen size is set for a small 600X350 screen, but you can enlarge
it by increasing the pixel size in the code (remember to change the dx
attributes to match!). Also, by un-commenting items in the animatedModule
you can add more things.  
NOTE: mostly experimental
